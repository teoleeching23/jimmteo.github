J20120071-1-S1,I,Inbound Job,PTD,Sea,Thailand,Singapore,"Happy crew, skilled and advised on the unpacking due to limited space. 

Email after our reply:
On the whole I appreciate the efforts of the whole team. There will always be cultural differences that may lead to some miscommunications or damages (our tv consol arrived damaged as it was stacked on the side resting on the extended edge rather than on the 4 main legs), we can take those in our stride.

And I would have really like to choose “maybe” as an option, not “no” when asked if I wld recommend. “Maybe” because I feel after sales communication and follow up should be stronger as we will always be in “limbo” till everything is delivered and unpacked. However the presale was great, the in between was alright so just post sale. Perhaps your survey should allow a Maybe option?

Thank you,
Jill
