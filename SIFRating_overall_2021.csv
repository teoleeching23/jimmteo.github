I wanted to let you know that my husband -who is very very particular and rather stressed right now! -has just called to give me the MOST GLOWING feedback on Asian Tigers.  He said everything has been done to a super high standard, the team were positive, helpful, proactive, efficient, accommodating, flexible and just all round the best removal firm he has ever worked with (and he has lived in dozens of places).

A HUGE thank you for all your help -being away has been hard but I know Lee felt above and beyond supported by you -a HUGE THANK YOU!
